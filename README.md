## Overview

Kani Chatbot is an interactive messenger-style chatbot solution developed as a submission for Challenge 2 in the Aloha Data AI Hackathon. This project leverages modern web technologies to create a responsive chat interface that supports both text and voice inputs. The chatbot utilizes a backend service to process user messages and generate responses‚Äîensuring an engaging and accessible user experience.


---

## Features

- A clean, modern chat UI with Responsive Design.
- Built-in voice input for converting speech to text and voice reply functionality for inclusive experience.
- HCDP navigation made Easier than ever
- Easily access, process, learn, plot climate data
- LLM-powered chat
- Fully modular functionality
- Your data privacy is secured

---

## Handled Security concerns:

* Prompt Injection Attacks:
>Malicious users can craft inputs that manipulate the model‚Äôs behavior. By embedding hidden instructions, attackers might force the LLM to produce unintended or harmful outputs.

>In our case, we don't answer anything that does not fall under either of two criteria - even when one criteria is selected, the response is driven by selective data. So injection is not possible


* Data Leakage:
>Since LLMs are trained on vast datasets, there's a risk they might inadvertently reveal sensitive or private information that was part of their training data, especially if prompted in specific ways.

>In our case, our answers are strictly restricted by the tools that retrieve public data. So it is not possible to get personal info from our chat.


* Adversarial Attacks:
>Attackers can design inputs to trick the model into making errors or generating inappropriate content. These subtle, crafted inputs can lead the model to produce outputs that deviate significantly from the intended response. 

>In our case, If the query can't be answered from the extracted dtaa, we refuse to answer at all preventing itself from adversarial attacks

## User Needs and Economic Impact Report

### Problem Statement

Despite the abundance of publicly available climate data for Hawai ªi, residents, students, researchers, and decision-makers struggle to access and interpret it effectively.

#### Current Platforms Are Often:
- Overly technical or fragmented
- Difficult to navigate for non-experts
- Lacking intuitive visualizations or summaries
- Not designed for conversational access or personalized insights

As climate risks intensify ‚Äî including rising sea levels, heatwaves, and shifting rainfall patterns ‚Äî there is an urgent need to make climate information more accessible, trustworthy, and actionable for the broader public.

#### Economic Cost of the Problem

- **Sea level rise alone** threatens over **$19 billion** in property value statewide.
- Poor access to data hinders climate adaptation, increasing future costs of recovery and health impacts.
- Delayed action reduces effectiveness of investments in resilience.
- Researchers and students lose hundreds of hours navigating complex portals.

**Even a 1% improvement** in climate decision-making could save **tens of millions** across sectors.

#### Estimated Cost of the Problem (Annual)

| Problem Area               | Users / Basis                          | Cost         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Wasted Productivity        | 2,000 users √ó 10 hours √ó $40/hr         | $800,000     |
| Poor Adaptation / Planning | 0.5% of $19B potential damages          | $95,000,000  |
| Inefficient Use of Funds   | 1.5% of $100M annual budget             | $1,500,000   |
| Lost Educational Value     | 5,000 students √ó $50/student            | $250,000     |
| **Total Annual Cost**      |                                        | **$97.55 million** |
