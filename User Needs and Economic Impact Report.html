    <h1>User Needs and Economic Impact Report</h1>
    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>Despite the abundance of publicly available climate data for Hawaiʻi, residents, students, researchers, and decision-makers struggle to access and interpret it effectively.</p>
    <h2>Current Platforms Are Often:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Overly technical or fragmented</li>
      <li>Difficult to navigate for non-experts</li>
      <li>Lacking intuitive visualizations or summaries</li>
      <li>Not designed for conversational access or personalized insights</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As climate risks intensify — including rising sea levels, heatwaves, and shifting rainfall patterns — there is an urgent need to make climate information more accessible, trustworthy, and actionable for the broader public.</p>
    <h2>Economic Cost of the Problem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Sea level rise alone</span> threatens over <strong>$19 billion</strong> in property value statewide.</li>
      <li>Poor access to data hinders climate adaptation, increasing future costs of recovery and health impacts.</li>
      <li>Delayed action reduces effectiveness of investments in resilience.</li>
      <li>Researchers and students lose hundreds of hours navigating complex portals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Even a 1% improvement</strong> in climate decision-making could save <strong>tens of millions</strong> across sectors.</p>
